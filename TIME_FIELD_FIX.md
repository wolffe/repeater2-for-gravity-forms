# Time Field Fix for Repeater for Gravity Forms Plugin

## Issue Fixed
Time fields were not working properly inside repeaters, especially with multiple repeaters on the same form.

## Root Cause
Time fields in Gravity Forms use a specific initialization function (`gformInitTimepicker`) that wasn't being called when repeater items were cloned.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Added Time Field Detection**
- Time fields are automatically detected as `childType == 'time'` through the existing field type detection system
- The plugin already had support for detecting `ginput_container_time` classes

### 2. **Added Time Field Reinitialization**
- **In cloned elements**: Added specific handling for time fields when cloning repeater items
- **In main initialization**: Added time picker initialization to the main setup function
- **In field processing**: Added time field handling alongside date field processing

### 3. **Code Changes Made**

#### A. Cloned Element Handling
```javascript
// Handle time fields in cloned elements
clonedElement.find('.gfield_time').each(function () {
    var timeField = jQuery(this);
    // Reset time field values
    timeField.find('input').val('');
    // Reinitialize time field if needed
    if (window['gformInitTimepicker']) {
        gformInitTimepicker();
    }
});
```

#### B. Main Reinitialization
```javascript
// Reinitialize other Gravity Forms field types for cloned elements
if (window['gformInitFileUpload']) { gformInitFileUpload(); }
if (window['gformInitChosenFields']) { gformInitChosenFields(); }
if (window['gformInitTimepicker']) { gformInitTimepicker(); }
```

#### C. Field Processing
```javascript
// Handle time fields
if (window['gformInitTimepicker'] && childType == 'time') {
    // Reset time field and reinitialize
    setTimeout(function() {
        if (window['gformInitTimepicker']) {
            gformInitTimepicker();
        }
    }, 100);
}
```

### 4. **Version Update**
- Updated from 2.1.3 to 2.1.4 to reflect the time field fix

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with multiple repeaters** containing time fields
2. **Test adding/removing repeater items** to ensure time fields work in all instances
3. **Test form submission** to ensure time data is saved correctly
4. **Test email notifications** to ensure time data is included

## Files Modified
- `js/gf-repeater2.js` - Added time field handling and reinitialization
- `repeater2-for-gravity-forms.php` - Updated version to 2.1.4

The time fields should now work properly in all repeater scenarios, including forms with multiple repeaters.
